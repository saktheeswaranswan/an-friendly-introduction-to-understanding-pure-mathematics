Here’s your requested table summarizing the passage in a clear structured way:

Period / Figure	Key Developments / Concepts	Main Contributions / Results
Ancient Era (Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes)	Two independent streams: formal deduction (logic) and mathematical analysis (geometry, infinitesimals)	Aristotle formalized deduction rules (in natural language); Archimedes laid groundwork for analysis.
1600–1700 (Newton & Leibniz)	Calculus invented, bridging mathematics and logic.	Introduced derivative & integral (with infinitesimals). Sparked later clarification debates.
Mid-19th Century (~1850)	Convergence of logic & mathematics begins.	Boole introduces symbolic logic; Frege develops predicate calculus (basis for modern logic).
Symbolism	Connectives: ∧ (and), ∨ (or), ¬ (not). Quantifiers: ∀x (“for all x”), ∃x (“there exists x”). Predicates P(x), Q(x).	Any mathematical statement can be expressed in predicate calculus.
Analysis Clarification (Bolzano, Dedekind, Cantor)	Precise handling of derivatives & integrals → required infinite sets.	Origin of set theory from analysis of infinite sets of real numbers.
Cantor’s Set Theory (1870s–1880s)	Investigated infinite sets: countable vs. uncountable.	- Rational numbers countable (zig-zag enumeration).
- Real numbers uncountable (diagonal argument).
- Subsets of a set always more numerous than the set itself (power set).
Russell (1900s)	Attempted to reduce mathematics to logic (logicism).	Showed mathematics = logic + set theory. But paradoxes emerged (Russell’s Paradox).
Zermelo, Fraenkel, Skolem (1908–1922)	Axiomatic set theory created to avoid paradoxes.	Built sets from known objects stepwise. Resulted in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF).
Formal Theories & Models	Every domain expressed as symbols → susceptible to multiple interpretations (“models”).	Needed to consider unintended models.
Lowenheim (1915)	Lowenheim Theorem: every theory has countable models.	Even theories about uncountable domains can have countable models.
Skolem (1920s)	Sharpened Lowenheim’s result → “Skolem Paradox.”	How can axioms proving uncountable sets exist be satisfied by a countable model? (Explored later.)
Turing (1936)	Recursive functions formalized (basis of computation).	Linked computability to logic.
Gödel (1930, 1931, 1938)	1930: Completeness of predicate calculus.
1931: Incompleteness of arithmetic.
1938: Consistency of continuum hypothesis/axiom of choice (developments continued).	Established limits of formal systems.
Cohen (1963)	Independence results for continuum hypothesis & axiom of choice.	Showed these can’t be proved or disproved from standard axioms.

2. Arithmetic and Incompleteness (1931)

When you move from pure logic to arithmetic (natural numbers with + and ×), you’d like a system that proves all true statements about numbers.

Gödel’s incompleteness theorem says you can’t: for any consistent system strong enough for arithmetic, there will always be true statements you can’t prove inside the system.

Gödel achieved this by:

Encoding formulas and proofs as numbers (“arithmetization of syntax”).

Using a version of Cantor’s diagonal argument.

Defining functions built from addition/multiplication that we’d now call recursive functions (later shown to coincide with all computable functions).

3. Computability (1930s)

People wondered if Gödel’s functions really captured all possible computable functions.

Church (lambda-calculus), Turing (Turing machines), and others proposed different formalisms.

All turned out equivalent — the Church–Turing thesis: “computable” has a precise formal meaning.

Once “mechanical procedure” was pinned down, people could prove unsolvability results (e.g. no algorithm to decide every mathematical truth).

4. Undecidability of Predicate Calculus

Even though predicate calculus is complete (all valid formulas are derivable), it is not decidable:

There’s no single algorithm that, given an arbitrary formula, tells you in finite time whether it’s valid.

Alonzo Church proved this in the 1930s.

5. Set Theory: Axiom of Choice and Continuum Hypothesis

Axiom of Choice (AC): From each set in a collection of sets, you can choose one element. Seems trivial in pictures, but very powerful.

Continuum Hypothesis (CH): There’s no set whose size is strictly between the natural numbers and the real numbers.

Gödel (1938): Showed AC and CH are consistent with standard set theory (ZFC) — they can’t be disproved from the usual axioms.

Cohen (1963): Showed the negations of AC and CH are also consistent — they can’t be proved either.

So AC and CH are independent of ZFC.

6. The Completeness Proof Sketch (Gödel–Henkin)

To prove the completeness theorem you:

Start with a consistent set of formulas.

Add a denumerable supply of new constants (“witnesses”) for existential statements.

Extend the set step by step (Lindenbaum’s lemma) until it’s maximal consistent — for every sentence φ, either φ or ¬φ is in the set.

Build a model whose domain consists of these constants and whose relations reflect which formulas are in the set.

Show this model satisfies all formulas in the extended set.

Therefore every consistent set has a model; equivalently, if a formula is true in all models, it’s provable.

That’s the essence of the Gödel–Henkin completeness theorem.

Key Takeaways

Completeness: first-order logic = all valid formulas can be proved.

Incompleteness: arithmetic = some true statements unprovable.

Undecidability: no algorithm to decide validity of all formulas.

Computability: many equivalent ways to define it (recursive functions, Turing machines, lambda-calculus).

Independence: some set-theoretic statements (AC, CH) neither provable nor disprovable.

Would you like me to draw a diagram that visually maps this history (from completeness → incompleteness → computability → undecidability → AC/CH)? It’s often much clearer that way.

Here’s the passage you pasted reorganised into a table format so you can see each main idea / theorem and its explanation side by side.

Topic / Statement	Explanation / Details
Isomorphism limits	A set of sentences 
Γ
Γ may have models isomorphic to the standard one (like 
N
N) and other models that are not. Knowing only that a structure satisfies 
Γ
Γ does not determine what the objects “are.”
Lemma (finite inconsistency)	If 
Γ
Γ is inconsistent, some finite subset of 
Γ
Γ is inconsistent. (Reason: derivations are finite sequences; only finitely many formulas from 
Γ
Γ appear.)
Gödel–Henkin theorem	If 
Γ
Γ is consistent (possibly infinite), it has a model.
Compactness Theorem	If every finite subset of 
Γ
Γ has a model, then 
Γ
Γ has a model. (Proof: every finite subset consistent → whole set consistent → Gödel–Henkin gives a model.)
Example with language 
L+

	Extend language 
L
L by a new constant 
c
c. Add infinitely many formulas 
φn

	​

 saying “there is a chain of length 
n
n ending at 
c
c.” Each finite subset can be modelled by 
(N,<,k)
(N,<,k) for large enough 
k
k. By Compactness, all sentences together have a model. This yields a non-standard model with an element “bigger” than every natural number.
Use of Compactness for normal models	If 
Γ
Γ has arbitrarily large finite normal models, then 
Γ
Γ has an infinite normal model. (Add infinitely many new constants 
ci
c
i
	​

 and distinctness formulas; each finite subset is satisfiable; Compactness gives an infinite model.)
Countable models from Gödel–Henkin	Any consistent set of sentences in a countable language (with equality axioms) has a countable normal model. Even real-number theories like 
(R,<,+,⋅)
(R,<,+,⋅) have countable models satisfying the same first-order sentences. This leads to the Löwenheim–Skolem phenomenon.
Skolem “paradox”	A countable model of set theory can satisfy “there is an uncountable set.” Inside the model, the bijection with 
N
N may not be a member of the model, so internally the set is “uncountable.”
Löwenheim–Skolem–Tarski theorem	If a set 
Γ
Γ of sentences in a countable language has an infinite normal model, then it has normal models of all infinite cardinalities. First-order sentences cannot pin down the cardinality of an infinite domain.
Take-away from model theory	We know: (1) every consistent theory has a countable model; (2) every infinite model yields models of all infinite sizes; (3) the same first-order sentences may hold in very different structures.
Turing Machines & computability (intro)	Mathematical logic also studies infinite classes of statements using systematic (mechanical) methods. Turing and Post (1936) gave a precise analysis of computation—Turing machines.

- Action determined by (state, scanned symbol): either replace symbol, move left, or move right. Halts if no instruction.
Machine specification	Finite table of quadruples: 
(state,symbol)→(act,next state)
(state,symbol)→(act,next state). No two quadruples have same (state, symbol) pair.
Example operation	Shows how scanning and applying rules moves the head left/right and changes state until halting.
Memory via markers	Because internal states are finite, unbounded memory must be handled with markers on the tape. Basic machines are built for tasks like searching for a symbol, placing markers, moving and erasing, shifting blocks, etc.

Here’s your entire pasted text reorganised into one clean, complete table so that each block of ideas sits side by side with its explanation.

Here’s the part you posted (pp. 24–30) turned into a table form so each key concept / result and its meaning stands side-by-side. This keeps the narrative but makes it easy to see the structure.

Topic / Result	Key Idea / Summary
Isomorphic models	Two models are isomorphic if they have the same structure but possibly different underlying elements. Properties and relations correspond exactly. Differences are only in the nature of elements, not in structure.
Non-isomorphic model example	Built a set 
B
B of points between 0 and 3 using fractions such as 
1−1/n
1−1/n, 
1+1/n
1+1/n, 
3−1/n
3−1/n. The model 
(B,<)
(B,<) satisfies the same sentences as the natural numbers but is not isomorphic to 
(N,<)
(N,<) because some points (like 
1−
1
−
) have infinitely many predecessors.
Lesson from example	A theory 
Σ
Σ (the set of sentences) can have the standard model 
(N,<)
(N,<), other models isomorphic to it, and also non-isomorphic models. The theory alone does not fix the exact nature or size of the domain.
Lemma (finite inconsistency)	If a set of sentences 
Σ
Σ is inconsistent, then some finite subset of 
Σ
Σ is inconsistent. (Proof uses the fact that derivations are finite sequences of formulas.)
Gödel–Henkin theorem	Any consistent set of sentences (possibly infinite) has a model.
Compactness Theorem	If every finite subset of a set of sentences 
Σ
Σ has a model, then 
Σ
Σ itself has a model. (Proof: lemma → consistency → Gödel–Henkin.)
Example of Compactness	Extend the language by a new constant 
c
c and add infinitely many sentences “there is a chain of length 
n
n ending at 
c
c.” Each finite subset has a model 
(N,<,k)
(N,<,k) for large enough 
k
k. Compactness yields a model containing an element larger than all naturals — a non-standard model.
Using Compactness for infinite models	If a theory has arbitrarily large finite normal models, then it has an infinite normal model. (Add infinitely many new constants 
ci
c
i
	​

 with distinctness conditions; each finite subset can be modelled; Compactness gives an infinite model.)
Countable models	Gödel–Henkin’s proof also shows that any consistent set of sentences in a countable language with equality axioms has a countable normal model. Even the real-number theory 
(R,<,+,⋅)
(R,<,+,⋅) has a countable model satisfying the same first-order sentences.
Skolem “paradox”	A countable model of set theory can satisfy “there is an uncountable set.” Inside the model the bijection with 
N
N may not belong to the model, so the set is internally “uncountable” although externally countable.
Löwenheim–Skolem–Tarski theorem	If a set 
Σ
Σ of sentences in a countable language has an infinite normal model, then 
Σ
Σ has normal models of all infinite cardinalities. First-order sentences cannot pin down the cardinality of an infinite domain.
Overall points from model theory	1) Every consistent theory has a countable model. 2) Every infinite model yields models of all infinite sizes. 3) The same first-order sentences may hold in very different structures. Axioms do not determine the actual objects.
Toward computation	After this discussion, the text moves to “Turing Machines and Recursive Functions,” analysing infinite classes of statements by systematic (mechanical) methods. This leads to the definition of Turing machines.


Here’s the long “Turing Machines and Recursive Functions” section turned into a table so you can see at a glance what each part is saying, what the main pieces of the machine are, and what the examples illustrate:

Section / Idea	Main Points / Summary
Context	Logic deals with infinite classes of statements; often we find mechanical (algorithmic) methods (positive results). But for some problems (e.g. deciding truth of an arbitrary predicate-calculus statement) no such method is known → candidate for negative results. To prove impossibility we first need a definition of computability.
Need for a definition	To show “no mechanical method exists” you need a precise definition of “mechanical” that covers all possible computations. This naturally leads to Turing’s model.
Turing & Post (1936)	Independently gave a precise analysis of “computation” → Turing machines. Evidence suggests Turing machines capture all effectively computable procedures (Church–Turing thesis).
Turing machine components	- Tape: infinite both ways, divided into squares.
- Alphabet: finite set of symbols

- Head: reads one square at a time.
- States: finite set 
q0,q1,…,qm
q

	​

,q
1
	​

,…,q
m
	​

.
- Actions: at each step, determined by (state, scanned symbol):
(i) replace symbol, (ii) move right, (iii) move left.
Machine table (quadruples)	Each instruction is a quadruple: (current state, scanned symbol) → (action, next state). No two quadruples start with same (state, symbol). If no quadruple for (state, symbol), machine halts.
Running example	Tape initially has 
S1S2S2S1S2…
S

	​

. First instruction executes (q₁ S₁ L q₂); head moves left; new situation shown. Second instruction executes (q₂ S₂ L q₂); repeated until halts.
Interpretation of states	Internal states = “mental notes.” Because head sees only one square at a time, states store limited memory of what’s been scanned.
Complexity	Tables get long even for simple tasks. So we build a library of basic machines and combine them by renumbering states.
Basic machine tasks	1. Search right for 
Sj
S
j
	​

: keep moving right until symbol 
Sj
S
j
	​

 found, then halt or switch to new state.
2. Put or remove a marker on S: replace S with S′ or vice versa; markers act like movable pebbles on the tape.
3. Move right, erasing markers: move right and restore marked symbols to unmarked until some stop symbol reached.
4. Shift block right: uses special “remember S” state qR and “deliver S” state qD for each symbol; effectively copies symbol to next square.
Why markers matter	Because the number of internal states is fixed, but many computations need unbounded memory. Machines use tape markings to simulate unlimited memory (zig-zagging, marking squares to count or compare blocks).
Composite example	Machine to double a block of 1’s: copies one square at a time into blank portion, marks each copied symbol, stops when no unmarked symbols left, then erases markers and halts. Shows how a complex task is built from basic tasks.
Big picture	This chapter shows: once you fix a formal definition of computation (Turing machines), you can (a) exhibit positive results (construct machines for tasks) and (b) prove negative results (some tasks no machine can do, e.g. general validity of predicate calculus).


Here’s a structured summary of your text in table form, capturing the main points, definitions, and flow of the argument:

Section / Idea	Main Points / Summary
Partial Recursive Functions	- Numbers represented as blocks of 1’s (n+1 for number n).
- Each Turing machine M defines a partial function φ_M(n) = # of 1’s left after computation.
- Partial function: M may not halt on some inputs.
- Total function (recursive) if defined for all inputs.
- Example: φ(n) = 2n is partial recursive; multiplication φ(m, n) = m × n also partial recursive.
Solvability / Decidability	- A class of questions Q is solvable/decidable if a Turing machine M exists that:
• Stops on 1 if answer is YES.
• Stops on 0 if answer is NO.
- Example: Euclidean algorithm can be encoded in a Turing machine to decide “is c the GCD of a and b?”
Standard Description of Turing Machines	- Any Turing machine can be represented as a finite string of symbols.
- Symbols used: 0, 1, I', I", … for states and tape symbols.
- Each quadruple (instruction) encoded using a six-symbol alphabet: D, 1, I', q, R, L.
- Standard description r(M) = word representing M.
Unsolvable Problem (Halting Problem)	- Define Q_M: “Does M applied to r(M) halt?”
- Suppose S solves Q_M; apply S to r(S) → leads to contradiction:
• S halts → S does not halt.
• S does not halt → S halts.
- Conclusion: no Turing machine can decide the halting problem → algorithmically unsolvable.
- t_φ(M) = function representing halting problem → not partial recursive.
Universal Machine (U)	- U exists: can simulate any Turing machine M on any input P.
- Problem reduces to “does U applied to input W halt?” → still unsolvable.
- Construction: markers track current state and scanned tape symbol.
- Operations include moving symbols, replacing blocks, and simulating quadruples.
Turing Machines as Word Transformations	- Machine situations represented as words (state + tape symbols + markers).
- Word transformations correspond to quadruples.
- Extended M-calculus handles halting: special rules reduce words to 0 when M halts.
Translation to Predicate Calculus	- Constants: symbols of V-calculus; function f links letters into words.
- Predicate Tr represents transformations: W1 → W2 if W1 transforms into W2.
- Axioms encode:
1. Linking function: (x(yz)) = ((xy)z)
2. Transformations: xTy → xT'y
3. Transitivity: (x→y & y→z) → x→z
- Single formula t/J = conjunction of all axioms.
Undecidability in Predicate Calculus	- W → 0 in M-calculus ⇔ t/J ⊢ (W → 0).
- Halting problem unsolvable → no algorithm can decide deducibility in predicate calculus.
- By completeness theorem, logically valid formulas also undecidable.

You’ve provided a very thorough excerpt explaining Gödel’s incompleteness theorems in the context of formal arithmetic. Let me summarize and clarify the key points in a structured way so it’s easier to digest:

1. Hilbert’s Programme and the Problem

Hilbert aimed to find a complete formal system: a system where all true mathematical statements are provable, and only true statements are provable.

Gödel showed that for any formal system F that includes arithmetic:

There exists a statement in F that is true but not provable.

The consistency of F cannot be proved within F itself.

2. Formal Arithmetic

Considers natural numbers 
0,1,2,...
0,1,2,... and operations 
+
+ and 
×
×.

Includes successor function 
s(x)
s(x) to represent 
x+1
x+1.

Uses induction: if 
0
0 has a property and 
n
n having it implies 
n+1
n+1 has it, then all numbers have it.

Peano axioms (simplified):

0
0 is not the successor of any number: 
∀x,0≠sx
∀x,0

=sx

Successor is unique: 
sx=sy  ⟹  x=y
sx=sy⟹x=y

Addition:

x+0=x
x+0=x

x+sy=s(x+y)
x+sy=s(x+y)

Multiplication:

x⋅0=0
x⋅0=0

x⋅sy=x⋅y+x
x⋅sy=x⋅y+x

Induction schema:

(P(0)∧∀x(P(x)→P(sx)))→∀xP(x)
(P(0)∧∀x(P(x)→P(sx)))→∀xP(x)

3. Gödel Numbering

Each symbol in the language is assigned a unique number.

Formulas and sequences of formulas are encoded as unique numbers via prime factorization:

Example: a sequence of symbols 
a1,a2,...,an
a
1
	​

,a
2
	​

,...,a
n
	​

 becomes 
2g(a1)3g(a2)...png(an)
2
g(a
1
	​

)
3
g(a
2
	​

)
...p
n
g(a
n
	​

)
	​

, where 
g(ai)
g(a
i
	​

) is the Gödel number of 
ai
a
i
	​

.

This ensures a mechanical, computable way to check if a number represents a formula, a sequence, or a proof.

4. Representing Proofs in Arithmetic

Define a predicate 
Pf(x,y)
Pf(x,y): true if 
x
x is the Gödel number of a proof of formula 
y
y.

Pf
Pf is recursive/computable, meaning a Turing machine could check it.

More complex: 
Pf+(x,y,z)
Pf
+
(x,y,z) checks if 
x
x proves the formula obtained by substituting 
z
z into the free variable of formula 
y
y.

5. Constructing the “I am not provable” formula

Consider the formula 
∃xPf+(x,y,y)
∃xPf
+
(x,y,y) with a free variable 
y
y.

Let 
g
g be the Gödel number of this formula itself. Substitute 
g
g into 
y
y:

G:=∃xPf+(x,g,g)
G:=∃xPf
+
(x,g,g)

G
G essentially says: “There is no proof of me.”

Analysis:

If 
G
G were provable, then a proof of 
G
G exists → contradiction.

If 
¬G
¬G were provable, then we could prove 
G
G is unprovable → contradiction.

Conclusion: Neither 
G
G nor 
¬G
¬G is provable.

This is Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem: a formal arithmetic system cannot be both complete and consistent.

6. Importance

Provides a rigorous method to construct a true but unprovable statement in arithmetic.

Shows that consistency of arithmetic cannot be proved from within arithmetic itself.

If you want, I can also draw a visual diagram showing Gödel numbering, the formula 
G
G, and why neither 
G
G nor 
¬G
¬G is provable. This helps to see the self-reference mechanism clearly.

Do you want me to do that?


It looks like you’ve shared a long excerpt from a text on set theory and mathematical logic, covering topics from ordinals and cardinals to Cantor’s theorem, the Axiom of Choice, constructible sets, and Cohen’s forcing. I can help summarize, clarify, or explain specific parts. Here’s a structured overview of the key ideas presented in your text:

1. Comparing Set Sizes: Equivalence (~) and Strict Inequality (-<)

Two sets 
x
x and 
y
y have the same size (
x∼y
x∼y) if their elements can be paired off one-to-one.

If some elements are always left over, 
x
x is strictly smaller than 
y
y, written 
x−<y
x−<y.

Examples:

Any finite ordinal 
n
n is smaller than 
ω
ω (the first infinite ordinal), so 
n−<ω
n−<ω.

ω∼ω+1∼ω+2…
ω∼ω+1∼ω+2… because you can pair elements using a shift function.

2. Cantor’s Theorem

Statement: For any set 
a
a, the power set 
P(a)
P(a) is strictly larger than 
a
a: 
a−<P(a)
a−<P(a).

Proof sketch:

There is a function mapping each 
x∈a
x∈a to 
{x}∈P(a)
{x}∈P(a), showing 
a∼
a∼ some elements of 
P(a)
P(a).

Assume 
a∼P(a)
a∼P(a). Then define 
b={x∈a:x∉f(x)}
b={x∈a:x∈
/
f(x)} (diagonal argument).

Lead to a contradiction for any 
y∈a
y∈a, showing 
a≁P(a)
a

∼P(a).

Implication: Infinite sets can have different sizes, e.g., 
∣N∣<∣P(N)∣
∣N∣<∣P(N)∣.

3. Ordinals and Cardinals

Ordinals: Numbers representing the position in a well-ordered set. Finite ordinals 
0,1,2,…
0,1,2,…, infinite ones like 
ω
ω, 
ω+1
ω+1, etc.

Cardinals: Smallest ordinals of a given size (measure of “how many elements” a set has). Denoted 
ℵ0,ℵ1,ℵ2,…
ℵ
0
	​

,ℵ
1
	​

,ℵ
2
	​

,…

ℵ0=∣N∣
ℵ
0
	​

=∣N∣

ℵ1
ℵ
1
	​

 is the first uncountable cardinal.

Cardinality notation: 
∣x∣
∣x∣ denotes the size of set 
x
x.

4. Continuum Hypothesis (CH)

CH conjectures: 
2ℵ0=ℵ1
2
ℵ
0
	​

=ℵ
1
	​

 (the size of the real numbers is the next cardinal after 
ℵ0
ℵ
0
	​

).

Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH): For any infinite cardinal 
κ
κ, 
2κ=κ+
2
κ
=κ
+
 (the next cardinal).

5. Constructible Sets (Gödel’s L)

Idea: Build sets step-by-step, starting from the empty set:

M0=∅
M
0
	​

=∅

Mα+1=Mα∪Def(Mα)
M
α+1
	​

=M
α
	​

∪Def(M
α
	​

)

Mλ=⋃α<λMα
M
λ
	​

=⋃
α<λ
	​

M
α
	​

 for limit ordinals 
λ
λ

Def(A): Sets definable from parameters in 
A
A.

Properties:

Forms a model 
L
L where all axioms of ZF hold.

Axiom of Choice (AC) and GCH are true in 
L
L.

6. Forcing and Cohen’s Model

Goal: Show independence of CH from ZF.

Start with a countable transitive model 
M
M where CH holds.

Add “generic” subsets 
aα
a
α
	​

 to form a bigger model 
N
N, maintaining ZF axioms.

Cohen’s Truth Lemma: A statement is true in 
N
N if and only if some condition 
p
p forces it.

Result: Can build a model where CH is false, proving CH is independent of ZF.

7. Key Takeaways

Infinite sets come in many sizes (cardinals).

Cantor’s theorem guarantees larger sets via power sets.

AC is consistent with ZF, as shown via constructible sets.

CH cannot be proven or disproven from ZF alone (Cohen’s forcing shows independence).

If you want, I can also draw a diagram showing ordinals, cardinals, power sets, and CH/GCH, which usually makes this much easier to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?


Sure! I can summarize the main concepts from your text into a table form for clarity. Here’s a structured version:

That’s a lot of useful information! Just to clarify, how would you like me to summarize it all? For example:

A compact summary table of the entire development of mathematical logic and set theory?

A diagram mapping key milestones and relationships (e.g., Gödel → Turing → Cohen)?

A summary focused on specific concepts (e.g., incompleteness, CH, forcing)?

A study guide or cheat sheet format for exam prep?

Let me know your preference so I can tailor the summary to your needs.
